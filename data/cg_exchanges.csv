We founded ChainAction movement (twitter page). It is a non- profit movement. We are bounded by the common goal to bring blockchain out of the box by working for a sustainable future and making a real impact. 
We already participated and sponsored the STS&P (Smart Technology for Sustainable Development & Procurement) 2018 Conference and invited 33 blockchain start ups to present their ideas to the UN and public officials, but there is still a long way to go. So we will again sponsor it in 2019. The projects will have a chance to propose their ideas to UN OPS. We are in process of negotiated MoU with UN OPS. Link here
